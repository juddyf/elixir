#Start

"The morning before my last day of junior year, my parents took extra care to hug and kiss me goodbye - definitely strange, because they had never been the most physically affectionate of guardians."

"I really should have known from that."

"School ended that day around noon, the bell completely drowned out yelling and cheering. {w} Everyone was running away."
 
"{i}I{/i} got run into. {w}On purpose."

scene white #need a pic of Li
with hpunch

"???" "MIMIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"I tumble to the ground as cloth and color and the scent of fresh laundry crash into me. It takes a second for my vision to clear, and when it does, my mouth drops open."

"Li Han is standing in front of me, practically beaming as he pulls back from his monstrous hug to look at me."

"To me, he is an old family friend, someone who used to babysit me way back when, but to the world at large, he's a star - an idol to be exact, 1/6 of the famous {i}Phantasy{/i}."

"Phantasy is a Korean pop idol group that came onto the k-pop scene about five years ago and grew popular globally really quickly, mostly due to their catchy debut album and diverse group members."

"Unlike most k-pop groups, Phantasy had members from all over Asia, instead of just from Korea, which meant that when they toured internationally, almost one of the members always had home court advantage, drawing out huge crowds."

"Of course, I'm not really thinking about any of that right now."

m "What are you doing here?"

"It comes out in English, because that was my first language, but I try to fumble for the Chinese translation for Li. Before I can get it out, he's replying, though he's speaking in Chinese."

h "We're vacationing in the U.S. for a couple months - and you're coming with us!" #chinese

m "...Wait, what?!"

h "The company thought it would be a good idea because our families are old friends, and it's a good chance to learn English! The U.S. is going to be part of our international tours from now on, and most of us need a lot of practice. And I talked to your parents, and they said yes (you wouldn't believe how long negotiations took though), and I even got them to let us bring some of your friends!" #chinese

"He continues on talking, most of which I struggle to understand because my Chinese has really deteriorated and because he's speaking far too fast."

m "Friends?" #chinese

"The word comes out in Chinese instinctively, and it causes Li to stop his tirade and squint at me."

h "Your accent has grown bad." #chinese

h "And friends! We got in contact with them a while ago, and the company talked to their families. They all agreed. I just wanted to surprise you!" #chinese
